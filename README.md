# 42 Stalk

This is a simple Flask app that fetches students from the 42 API and displays them in a web interface.
The good part is that there is a filtering system that allows you to filter by exams, projects, by average final mark, and every other field that is available in the student's JSON object.

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.10 or newer
2. Run `init.sh` to create a virtual environment and install dependencies
3. Setup your .env with the 42 API credentials
4. Fetch the students data by running `./fetch-students.sh` or `./fetch-students.sh <CAMPUS_ID>`
   - Students are saved to `data/campus_<CAMPUS_ID>_students.json`
   - The campus becomes the default one in `config.json`
5. Run the app by running `./run-server.sh` and open http://localhost:8080
6. Enjoy the stalk!

### Which students file is used?

- `?campus_id=<id>` → `data/campus_<id>_students.json`
- otherwise `data/students.json` if it exists, then the `defaultCampus` from `config.json`, then any fetched campus

Every fetched campus shows up in the campus selector at the top of the page.

### Fetching campuses from the web app

The cloud button next to the campus selector (or <kbd>C</kbd>, or "Add or update campuses…" in the
selector) opens the campus manager: search the list of 42 campuses, fetch new ones or update the ones
you already have (one or many at once), pick the default campus, and refresh the campus list itself.
Fetches run in the background with live progress, and you can keep using the app meanwhile.
`./fetch-students.sh <CAMPUS_ID>` still works the same way from the terminal.

## Full scan (exams & projects)

The students list from the 42 API does not include exams, projects or levels. Enabling **Full scan**
fetches each matching student's profile (one API request per student, ~2 requests/second).
Field filters are applied *before* fetching: narrow the list down first (e.g. `pool_year`).

### Cache

Nothing fetched is ever thrown away:

- **Profiles** are kept in `data/cached_users.json`. A full scan only fetches the profiles that were
  never fetched; the others are used as they are, however old. **Rescan** (or `rescan`) also fetches
  again the profiles older than 12h. If the 42 API fails for a student, their previous profile is kept.
- **Student lists** (`data/campus_<id>_students.json`) are merged when fetched again: students are
  updated and added, and the ones the 42 API no longer returns stay in the file.
- In the campus manager, **Details** fetches the missing profiles of a campus, and **Rescan** fetches
  its student list again, then the missing and outdated profiles.

## Using the interface

- **Click-to-filter**: hover any value and click the funnel icon, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+click it to add it
  to the filters (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+click to exclude it). New filters stay pending until you press
  **Apply** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>).
- **Exams / Projects tabs**: search and select exams or projects, filter by result, status and mark,
  keep only the best attempt, and compare students in the matrix view.
- **Cards / List**: the list view shows larger photos with stats, exam results and recent projects.
  Click any photo to enlarge it (<kbd>←</kbd>/<kbd>→</kbd> to browse).
- **Student details**: click a student for every field, all exams and projects, and the raw JSON.
- Press <kbd>?</kbd> for keyboard shortcuts.

## Query parameters

Filters live in the URL, so any view can be shared or bookmarked.

| Parameter | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `<any field>` | e.g. `pool_year=2025`, `kind===student`, `wallet=>=100`, `location=!=` (online) |
| `fullscan` | fetch exams/projects for each student |
| `rescan` | with `fullscan`, also fetch again the profiles older than 12h (the page's **Rescan** button sends it once and never keeps it in the URL) |
| `examname` / `projectname` | name or slug contains (`\|` separates alternatives) |
| `exam_mark`, `exam_status`, `exam_validated`, `exam_required` | narrow students by their exams (same with `project_`) |
| `level`, `average_exam_final_mark`, `cpiscine_final_mark`, `exams_passed`, … | computed fields (need `fullscan`) |

Conditions accept `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `==`, `!=` prefixes; without a prefix the value means "contains".
Numbers are compared numerically.
